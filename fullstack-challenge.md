### Fullstack challenge

#### Prework

Before starting, please remove reference to `Stories` component in the `Main` view as it's not a scope of this task. 

#### Backend

Extend the application to add new endpoints for:

- Fetching one specific employee
  - by name
  - by id
- Provide methods to add, modify and delete an employee
- Add a new API route for statistics and add methods to get
  - number of employees
  - number of hired employees (tips: look at the email address)
  - number of employees per character in the alphabet - histogram

#### Frontend

Given the backend API, create a GUI using the API endpoints. 

It should present a view of the list of employees and allow basic CRUD operations on this list.
